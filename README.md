# GrUpSe

Welcome to the GrUpSe curve fitting repository.
This application is written in Python using the Shiny framework.

## How to run

Before starting this Python application make sure to install all dependencies from the environment first:

```bash
# install virtual env first
sudo apt install python3-virtualenv

# if the last command fails, run this beforehand:
# chmod +x install_requirements.sh
source ./install_requirements.sh
```

After that run the following command in the `/src` directory to start the Shiny application:

```bash
shiny run
```
